Loot Randomizer is a mod for Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel that provides repeated new playthrough experiences, by means of shuffling every item in the game into new drop locations.

When playing Loot Randomizer, you create a seed, and your game's loot sources are assigned all new drops based on that seed. Your Knuckle Dragger may drop the Norfleet, while your Hyperius drops The Cradle.

In addition to enemies, missions are also assigned new quest rewards, and made to be infinitely repeatable such that they can be farmed without resetting your playthrough. Your 'Shoot This Guy In The Face' mission may reward a purple Jakobs sniper each turn-in, while your 'Beard Makes The Man' mission gives Lucrative Opportunity relics.

Each loot source had been hand-tuned to provide fair loot generosity. Longer missions give multiple instances of their quest reward, for example, and raid bosses drop multiple of their assigned drop guaranteed. If you don't get a drop from an enemy on the first try, they will drop a 'hint' item instead, giving you the option to decide whether to keep farming them.

Seeds can be configured with different options regarding what types of content to include, such as the ability to disable rare enemies or enable raid bosses. They can also be shared with friends (for fun competitive scenarios), and can accomodate any DLCs being owned or unowned.

Loot Randomizer works in co-op, with the best experience if all players run the mod (however this is not strictly necessary). The host player's seed will be the one which is in effect in co-op. Loot Randomizer is also compatible with most other mods, including major overhauls (e.g. UCP, BL2fix, Reborn). However, others which increase the number of items or enemies in the game will not fully integrate with it (e.g. Exodus).
