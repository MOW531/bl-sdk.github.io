## Text Guide

1. Download the latest release from github.

   ![Github download page](/assets/images/oak-installation/00-download.png)

   Make sure to download the right release for your game, and not either of the source code links.

2. Locate your game files.

   The default locations are:    
   Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\<game>`    
   Epic: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\<game>`    

   In Steam, you can also find this via RMB -> Manage -> Browse Local Files.

   The Gamepass version is not currently supported.

3. Open up the zip you downloaded, and extract it's contents directly into the game folder, such
   that they merge.

   If you're asked to overwrite existing files, accept.

4. \[PROTON ONLY\] When playing on Linux via Proton, you need to add the following launch arg:
   ```
   WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dsound=n,b" %command%
   ```

   [See the faq for more]({{ "/oak-mod-db/faq/#can-i-use-this-on-steam-decklinuxmac" | relative_url }}).

5. The SDK should be installed now. To verify:
   - In BL3, you should see a new `MODS` option on the main menu. You can click this to start
     configuring your mods.

   - In WL, hit tilde (`` `/~ ``) twice to open console, and you should see a message saying the
     console mod menu has been loaded. Type `mods` and press enter to start configuring your mods.

6. To install SDK mods, navigate back to the `sdk_mods` folder you extracted during step 3. SDK mods
   come in two forms:
   - `.sdkmod` files can be dropped directly into this folder.

   - `.zip` files contain an inner folder you need to extract, in a similar manner to how you
     extracted the sdk.

     Make sure that when you extract you don't accidentally create two nested folders, this will not
     work.

7. After installing SDK mods, you need to restart the game for them to get loaded.
